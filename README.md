## 🎖 About Me

🔹 **Former Musician & Sergeant, United States Army**  
During my tenure as a Noncommissioned Officer in the United States Army, I honed my leadership, strategic thinking, and commitment to excellence through military music, traditions, and public relations. I've had the privilege of performing for embassies across Lithuania and Estonia, as well as public concerts in Poland and Latvia. These experiences, diverse locations, and collaborations have left an indelible impact on me.

🔹 **Music Education Background**  
Prior to my military service, I pursued Music Education at the University of North Texas. Specializing in teaching private lessons and Middle/High School Band, I was a finalist in the National Trumpet Competition's Large Ensemble Division. Additionally, I performed at the Texas Music Education Association convention and contributed to three commercially released CDs with the North Texas Wind Symphony and Symphonic Band.

🔹 **Applying Music Skills to Software Engineering**  
Playing music professionally demanded a growth mindset, structure, creativity, and teamwork—skills integral to Software Engineering. Requiring clear yet tactful communication during rehearsals, analyzing auditory cues while focusing on performance, and blending historical musical styles with personal nuances mirror the demands of software development.
